== Project Setup
This is my basic setup for a new CMake project:

[source,bash]
----
.
├── build
│   └── .keep
├── CMakeLists.txt
└── evo.cpp
----

This is my go to setup for creating a basic project. The main entrypoint isn't complicated either.  This is just a basic template I use when creating new projects:

[source,cpp]
----
// evo.cpp

#include <iostream>

int main() {
  std::cout << "Press [ENTER] to exit..." << std::endl;
  std::cin.get();

  return 0;
}
----
